# Improvements & Additional Feature Suggestions (Functional, Not UI)

## Potential Improvements
1. **Data Caching**  
   Store previously viewed weather data locally to reduce API calls and improve speed.
2. **Severe Weather Alerts**  
   Integrate government alert APIs (like PAGASA, NOAH) to inform users about typhoons, floods, or other severe events.
3. **Weather-based Recommendations**  
   Provide suggestions like irrigation timing, pest control, or harvest schedules based on current and forecasted conditions.
4. **Custom Notifications**  
   Allow users to set up custom alerts (ex: “Notify me if rain probability > 60% this week”).
5. **Historical Weather Trends**  
   Enable users to view weather statistics for a particular city or region by season or date range for planning and analysis.

## Additional Useful Features
- **API Failover**: Use a secondary weather API if the primary (OpenWeather) fails.
- **Location-based Grouping**: Group favorite locations by region or province.
- **Export Data**: Allow users to export weather and advisory data (CSV or PDF) for offline use or reporting.
- **Smart Farming Integration**: Support integration with IoT sensors (soil moisture, temp) for smarter advisories.
- **SMS Alerts**: Optionally send important weather advisories via SMS for users with limited internet access.
